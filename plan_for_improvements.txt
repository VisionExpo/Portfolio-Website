Information Gathered:
- ProjectCard.js and SkillCard.js use manual event listeners for hover animations, which is against React best practices. Cleanup functions do not properly remove event listeners, causing potential memory leaks.
- ContactSection.js uses React's onMouseEnter/onMouseLeave correctly but external links lack rel="noopener noreferrer" for security.
- main.js has issues with checking ScrollTrigger registration and missing ScrollToPlugin registration, which may cause runtime errors.
- animations.js is well implemented with proper GSAP and plugin checks.
- styles.css is well structured with good use of CSS variables and animations. Minor accessibility improvements can be made.

Plan:
- ProjectCard.js
  - Replace manual event listeners with React onMouseEnter and onMouseLeave props.
  - Fix cleanup by removing event listeners properly or avoid manual listeners.
  - Add rel="noopener noreferrer" to external links.
- SkillCard.js
  - Same changes as ProjectCard.js for event listeners and cleanup.
- ContactSection.js
  - Add rel="noopener noreferrer" to all external links.
- main.js
  - Fix ScrollTrigger registration check.
  - Register ScrollToPlugin before usage.
  - Consider removing duplicate smooth scrolling logic and consolidate with animations.js.
- styles.css
  - Add focus styles for interactive elements for accessibility.
  - Review color contrast for accessibility compliance.

Dependent Files to be Edited:
- components/ProjectCard.js
- components/SkillCard.js
- components/ContactSection.js
- main.js
- styles.css

Follow-up Steps:
- Implement the above changes.
- Test hover animations and event handling in ProjectCard and SkillCard.
- Verify external links open safely with proper rel attributes.
- Test smooth scrolling and scroll-triggered animations.
- Check accessibility improvements in styles.
- Run the app and verify no console errors or warnings.

Please confirm if I can proceed with implementing this plan.
